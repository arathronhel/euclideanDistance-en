Calculation of Minimum Euclidean Distance


d = √(x₂-x₁)²+(y₂-y₁)²


The Euclidean distance is the "ordinary" straight line distance between two points in Euclidean space. With this formula you can find the distance between two points in the plane or in three-dimensional space.


Function:


Using the concepts of functions and loops in Python, you need to write a program that performs the following operations:


Identification of Points:


Create a list called 'points'. This list should contain tuples representing points in 2D space. For example, the point '(x, y)' will be represented as a tuple '(x, y)'.


Writing a Function for Euclidean Distance:


Define a function called 'euclideanDistance'. This function should take two tuples (each representing a point) and return the Euclidean distance between these two points.


Calculating Distances:


Using a loop, calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of points in the 'points' list. Store these distances in another list called 'distances'.


Finding the Minimum Distance:


Find the minimum distance from the 'distances' list and print it.
